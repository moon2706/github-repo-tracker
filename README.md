# 🚀 GitHub Repository Tracker (Trial Project)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was created as a **trial experiment** to understand and test the concepts behind **GitHub API integration, MongoDB storage**, and the **data-fetching & storing process** behind the scenes. The primary intent was to **explore how repository data can be dynamically retrieved from GitHub and stored efficiently** in a database.

Through this project, we gained insights into:
- **Fetching repositories from GitHub using API calls**
- **Storing structured data in MongoDB**
- **Setting up a backend to retrieve stored data**
- **Displaying fetched data in a user-friendly frontend UI**

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented
✅ **Fetch GitHub repositories dynamically**  
✅ **Store repository details in MongoDB**  
✅ **Prevent duplicate entries in the database**  
✅ **Provide an API to retrieve stored data**  
✅ **Create a clean frontend UI to display repository information**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Next.js** (Frontend & API routing)
- **MongoDB** (Database storage)
- **Mongoose** (Schema modeling)
- **GitHub API** (Fetching repository data)
- **Tailwind CSS** (UI styling)
- **Axios** (Handling API requests)
- **Dotenv** (Environment variable management)
